"Mixin" layer for adding latest Go toolchain versions into the Yocto Project LTS.

At the time Kirkstone was released in May 2022, Go 1.17 was the latest version
and officially Kirkstone supports only that. This thin special-purpose mixin
layer is meant to address this issue by backporting Go recipes from the master
branch of openembedded-core.

You can see what Go versions are provided by listing recipes-devtools/ content.

Including the layer automatically picks up the latest Go version; different versions
need to be set explicitly by adding the following line to your distro config 
or local.conf:

GOVERSION = "1.20%"
